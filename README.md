# The control costs of human brain dynamics

This is the code for the above publication. It is recommended to clone this repository in case you intend to reproduce the results from the paper. To do so, type in the terminal the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/NeuroenergeticsLab/control_costs.git`

### Directory
The files are sequentially ordered and tagged with an initial letter that differentiates different parts of the study:

- `A` : denotes `analysis` scripts, which include the generation of state maps using our described approach (A1), as well as the simulation of control costs (A2)
- `F` : denotes the scripts to generate `figures`, numbered according to their number in the publication
- `SI`: denotes analysis and visualization scripts, which belong to the `supplementary information`

### Data
Data is not found in this repository, but stored in [OSF](https://osf.io/nw9zt/). Make sure to extract the data into their respective folder, i.e., the HCP data into `data/hcp` and TUM into `data/tum`. 

### Do-It-Yourself
We encourage the use of our code in future projects. Should you use your own data, we recommend the use of our folder structure to have the smoothest repliacation expererience. However, in case of errors/issues, feel free to raise an [issue](https://github.com/NeuroenergeticsLab/control_costs/issues) in this repository.
